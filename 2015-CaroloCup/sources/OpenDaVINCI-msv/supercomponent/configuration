# The following attributes define the buffer sizes for recording and replaying.
# You need to adjust these parameters depending on the camera resolution for example (640x480x3 --> 1000000 for memorySegment, 1280x720x3 --> 2800000).

supercomponent.pulseshift.shift = 10000 # (in microseconds) If the managed level is pulse_shift, all connected modules will be informed about the supercomponent's real time by this increment per module. Thus, the execution times per modules are better aligned with supercomponent and the data exchange is somewhat more predictable.
